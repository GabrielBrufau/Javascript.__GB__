1. "extends": "@tsconfig/node18/tsconfig.json": This line indicates that the current tsconfig.json file extends the configuration settings from another <a href="https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/blob/main/bases/node18.json">base</a> tsconfig.json file located at @tsconfig/node18/tsconfig.json. 
2. "compilerOptions": { "outDir": "dist" }: The compilerOptions section is used to specify various options for the TypeScript compiler. In this case, it sets the "outDir" option to "dist". This means that the compiled JavaScript files will be placed in the "dist" directory. This is a common practice to keep the compiled files separate from the source files.
3. "include": ["src"]: The include property tells the TypeScript compiler which files or directories to include in the compilation process. In this case, it includes the "src" directory, meaning TypeScript files inside the "src" directory will be compiled.
4. "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.test.ts"]: The exclude property specifies which files or directories to exclude from the compilation process. Here, it excludes the "node_modules" directory (where external dependencies are installed), as well as any TypeScript files with the ".test.ts" extension (typically used for unit tests).
