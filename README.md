## Introduction
Althrough the years of 90, the most user was connec to internet with modems of low speed. in this years was starting to develop the first aplication web and therefore the web page start to include form more complex.
With increasingly complex web applications and such slow browsing speed, the need for a programming language that could run in the user's browser emerged. This way, if the user didn't fill out a form correctly, they wouldn't have to wait for a long time until the server displayed the form again, indicating the existing errors.
Brendan Eich, a programmer working at Netscape, thought he could solve this problem by adapting other existing technologies (such as ScriptEase) to the Netscape Navigator 2.0 browser, which wasset to be released in 1995. Initially, Eich named his language LiveScript.
Later, Netscape formed an alliance with Sun Microsystems for the development of the new programming language. Furthermore, just before the release, Netscape decided to change the name to JavaScript.
The first version of JavaScript was a complete success, and Netscape Navigator 3.0 already incorporated the next version of the language, version 1.1. At the same time, Microsoft released JScript with its Internet Explorer 3 browser. JScript was a copy of JavaScript with a name change to avoid legal issues.
To avoid a technology war, Netscape decided that the best approach would be to standardize the JavaScript language. As a result, in 1997, the JavaScript 1.1 specification was submitted to the ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) for standardization.
